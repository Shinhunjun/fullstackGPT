The origin of Santa Claus, one of the most beloved figures of childhood,
begins in the 4th century with Saint Nicholas. A Greek Christian,
Nicholas was Bishop of Myra, an area in present day Turkey. He was
renowned for his good deeds and devotion to children, and was also
believed to have used his wealth to secretly give gifts to those in
need.
Upon his death on December 6th in 346 A.D., St. Nicholas was buried in
Myra and shortly afterward he was elevated to sainthood. In 1087 his
remains were removed by Italian sailors and spirited to Bari, Italy
where they were placed in a basilica. St. Nicholas' reputation for
kindness and philanthropy, as well as claims of miracles he had
performed, served to increase devotion to him and his popularity spread
throughout Europe. St. Nicholas is the patron saint of many countries,
including Russia, where he is known by his red cape, flowing white
beard, and bishop's mitre. In Greece, he is the patron saint of sailors
and in Belgium the patron of children and travelers. As the patron saint
of seafarers in Greece, Sicily and Russia, thousands of churches across
Europe were built and dedicated to him, and some time around the 12th
century an official church holiday was created in his honor. The Feast
of St. Nicholas was celebrated December 6 and the day was marked by
gift-giving and charity.
After the movement to reform the Catholic church in the 16th and 17th
centuries, European followers of St. Nicholas dwindled, but his legend
was kept alive in Holland where the Dutch spelling of his name 'Sint
Nikolaas' was eventually transformed to 'Sinterklaas'. In Dutch lore,
Sinterklaas arrives on a ship from Spain with his assistant 'Zwarte
Piet' ~ meaning Black Pete ~ and Sisnterklaas then travels riding a
noble white horse, while Black Pete rides a mule. Dutch children would
leave their wooden shoes, or clogs, by the fireplace filled with carrots
and hay for the horse and mule, and Sinterklaas rewarded those who were
good by placing small treats in their shoes. In the 17th century, Dutch
colonists brought the tradition of Sinterklaas with them to America and
here the Anglican name of 'Santa Claus' emerged.
Present day New York City, once called New Amsterdam, was a Dutch
trading post during the 17th century and thus had a large Dutch
influence during that period and in ensuing years. In 1804, the New York
Historical Society was founded in America with St. Nicholas as its
patron saint. In 1809, famed American author Washington Irving, a member
of the Society, mentioned St. Nicholas in his satirical work A Complete
History of New York written under the pseudonym Diedrich Knickerbocker.
In his revised version of the book which was published in 1812, Irving
describes St. Nicholas: "—the good St. Nicholas came riding over the
tops of the trees, in that self-same wagon wherein he brings his yearly
presents to children."

Another New Yorker, printer William Gilley, published a poem in 1821 by
an unknown author titled A New Year's Present. In this poem,
"Santeclaus" is portrayed as the bringer of gifts to good and virtuous
children on Christmas Eve, while leaving birchen rods for those who are
naughty. Santeclaus soars over chimney tops being driven - for the first
time in written accounts - by a reindeer.
On December 23rd in 1823, the poem A Visit From St. Nicholas, appeared
in New York's Troy Sentinel. The poem was anonymously submitted, and
appeared in various publications for 13 years without listing an author.
It was later attributed to Bible professor Clement C. Moore, and Moore
himself claimed authorship of the piece in 1844. However, some evidence
exists that it may have been the work of another New Yorker, Major Henry
Livingtson, Jr., an American of Dutch descent. The poem is also known as
The Night Before Christmas, and in it Santa Claus is described:
He had a broad face and a little round belly, That shook when he
laughed, like a bowl full of jelly, He was chubby and plump, a right
jolly old elf, And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself; A wink
of his eye and a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.
Despite the authorship controversy, the poem's popularity helped to
spread the concept of Santa Claus as a plump, merry, bringer of gifts.
In the 21st century, the poem is still widely published, particularly in
book form, and has become a well-known part of Christmas tradition.
German-born American illustrator and editorial cartoonist Thomas Nast
played a role in developing the visual image of the modern Santa Claus.
Pictures of St. Nicholas and Sinterklaas frequently depicted a tall,
thin man wearing a long flowing cape or robe. In a series of drawings
for Harper's Weekly magazine, Nast drew Santa as jolly and plump, with a
white beard and wearing a fur-trimmed coat and pants along with a black
belt and boots — with a bit of a gnome-like appearance. Nast's first
drawing appeared in 1862 and, over the next 24 years, 76 of his
Christmas engravings were published.
The Coca-Cola company also played a part in creating the look of Santa
Claus that is so familiar to many of us today. In an effort to increase
their winter sales and their appeal to children, Coca-Cola hired
commercial artist Haddon Sundblom to create advertisements featuring a
happy, smiling Santa either holding, drinking, giving, or receiving Coca
Cola. Sundblom turned to the poem A Visit From St. Nicholas for
inspiration, and the first Coca-Cola Santa debuted in 1931 in The
Saturday Evening Post. From 1931 to 1964, the Michigan-born artist drew
popular holiday ads featuring Santa Claus with Coke, which appeared not
only in the Post, but in other publications including National
Geographic, Ladies Home Journal, The New Yorker, as well as in
calendars, billboards, posters and even plush dolls.
Other countries feature different gift-bearers for the Christmas or
Advent season: Father Christmas in England ~ Pere Noël, Father Christmas
or the Christ Child in France ~ La Befana in Italy ~ The Three Kings in
Spain, Puerto Rico, and Mexico ~ and Christkindl or the Christ Child in
Switzerland and Austria.
Christkindl, German for 'Christ Child', was promoted by protestant
reformer Martin Luther and intended to replace the figure of St.
Nicholas. Luther believed that the popularity of St. Nicholas detracted
from the true meaning of Christmas, which was the birth of Christ.
Christkindl is usually portrayed as an angelic child with wings and
golden curls. During the 18th century, the custom of Christkindl came to
America with German and Swiss settlers. It was later simplified to Kriss
Kringle, and in America is now synonymous with Santa Claus.
Still, the modern image of Santa Claus as a jolly, benevolent, plump man
in a red suit is a combination of the creative influences of authors and
illustrators such as Irving, Moore, Nast and Sundblom. It is an image
that is loved and recognized by children and adults alike around the
world.
The legend of Santa Claus can be traced back hundreds of years to a monk
named St. Nicholas. It is believed that Nicholas was born sometime
around A.D. 280 in Patara, near Myra in modern-day Turkey. Much admired
for his piety and kindness, St. Nicholas became the subject of many
legends. It is said that he gave away all of his inherited wealth and
traveled the countryside helping the poor and sick. One of the
best-known St. Nicholas stories is the time he saved three poor sisters
from being sold into slavery or prostitution by their father by
providing them with a dowry so that they could be married. 
Over the course of many years, Nicholas’s popularity spread and he
became known as the protector of children and sailors. His feast day is
celebrated on the anniversary of his death, December 6. This was
traditionally considered a lucky day to make large purchases or to get
married. By the Renaissance, St. Nicholas was the most popular saint in
Europe. Even after the Protestant Reformation, when the veneration of
saints began to be discouraged, St. Nicholas maintained a positive
reputation, especially in Holland.
St. Nicholas made his first inroads into American popular culture
towards the end of the 18th century. In December 1773, and again in
1774, a New York newspaper reported that groups of Dutch families had
gathered to honor the anniversary of his death.
The name Santa Claus evolved from Nick’s Dutch nickname, Sinter Klaas, a
shortened form of Sint Nikolaas (Dutch for Saint Nicholas). In 1804,
John Pintard, a member of the New York Historical Society, distributed
woodcuts of St. Nicholas at the society’s annual meeting. The background
of the engraving contains now-familiar Santa images including stockings
filled with toys and fruit hung over a fireplace. 
In 1809, Washington Irving helped to popularize the Sinter Klaas stories
when he referred to St. Nicholas as the patron saint of New York in his
book, The History of New York. As his prominence grew, Sinter Klaas was
described as everything from a “rascal” with a blue three-cornered hat,
red waistcoat, and yellow stockings to a man wearing a broad-brimmed hat
and a “huge pair of Flemish trunk hose.”
Gift-giving, mainly centered around children, has been an important part
of the Christmas celebration since the holiday’s rejuvenation in the
early 19th century. Stores began to advertise Christmas shopping in
1820, and by the 1840s, newspapers were creating separate sections for
holiday advertisements, which often featured images of the newly-popular
Santa Claus. 
In 1841, thousands of children visited a Philadelphia shop to see a
life-size Santa Claus model. It was only a matter of time before stores
began to attract children, and their parents, with the lure of a peek at
a “live” Santa Claus. In the early 1890s, the Salvation Army needed
money to pay for the free Christmas meals they provided to needy
families. They began dressing up unemployed men in Santa Claus suits and
sending them into the streets of New York to solicit donations. Those
familiar Salvation Army Santas have been ringing bells on the street
corners of American cities ever since.
Perhaps the most iconic department store Santa is Kris Kringle in the
1947 classic Santa Claus movie “Miracle on 34 Street.” A young Natalie
Wood played a little girl who believes Kris Kringle (played by Edmund
Gwenn, who won an Oscar for the role) when he says he is the real Santa
Claus. “Miracle on 34 Street” was remade in 1994 and starred Lord
Richard Attenborough and Mara Wilson.
The Macy’s Santa has appeared at almost every Macy’s Thanksgiving Day
Parade since it began in 1924, and fans of all ages still line up to
meet the Macy’s Santa in New York City and at stores around the country,
where children can take pictures on Santa’s lap and tell him what they
want for Christmas.
In 1822, Clement Clarke Moore, an Episcopal minister, wrote a long
Christmas poem for his three daughters entitled “An Account of a Visit
from St. Nicholas,” more popularly known as “‘Twas The Night Before
Christmas.” 
Moore’s poem, which he was initially hesitant to publish due to the
frivolous nature of its subject, is largely responsible for our modern
image of Santa Claus as a “right jolly old elf” with a portly figure and
the supernatural ability to ascend a chimney with a mere nod of his
head! Although some of Moore’s imagery was probably borrowed from other
sources, his poem helped popularize the now-familiar image of a Santa
Claus who flew from house to house on Christmas Eve in “a miniature
sleigh” led by eight flying reindeer to leave presents for deserving
children. “An Account of a Visit from St. Nicholas” created a new and
immediately popular American icon.
In 1881, political cartoonist Thomas Nast drew on Moore’s poem to create
the first likeness that matches our modern image of Santa Claus. His
cartoon, which appeared in Harper’s Weekly, depicted Santa as a rotund,
cheerful man with a full, white beard, holding a sack laden with toys
for lucky children. It is Nast who gave Santa his bright red suit
trimmed with white fur, North Pole workshop, elves and his wife, Mrs.
Claus
Eighteenth-century America’s Santa Claus was not the only St.
Nicholas-inspired gift-giver to make an appearance at Christmastime.
There are similar figures and Christmas traditions around the world.
Christkind or Kris Kringle was believed to deliver presents to
well-behaved Swiss and German children. Meaning “Christ child,”
Christkind is an angel-like figure often accompanied by St. Nicholas on
his holiday missions. In Scandinavia, a jolly elf named Jultomten was
thought to deliver gifts in a sleigh drawn by goats. English legend
explains that Father Christmas visits each home on Christmas Eve to fill
children’s stockings with holiday treats. Père Noël is responsible for
filling the shoes of French children. In Italy, there is a story of a
woman called La Befana, a kindly witch who rides a broomstick down the
chimneys of Italian homes to deliver toys into the stockings of lucky
children.
In the United States, Santa Claus is often depicted as flying from his
home to home on Christmas Eve to deliver toys to children. He flies on
his magic sleigh led by his reindeer: Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen,
Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen, and the most famous reindeer of all,
Rudolph. Santa enters each home through the chimney, which is why empty
Christmas stockings—once empty socks, now often dedicated stockings made
for the occasion—are “hung by the Chimney with care, in hopes that St.
Nicholas soon would be there,” as Clement Clarke Moore wrote in his
famous poem. Stockings can be filled with candy canes and other treats
or small toys.
Santa Claus and his wife, Mrs. Claus, call the North Pole home, and
children write letters to Santa and track Santa’s progress around the
world on Christmas Eve. Children often leave cookies and milk for
Santa and carrots for his reindeer on Christmas Eve. Santa Claus keeps a
“naughty list” and a “nice list” to determine who deserves gifts on
Christmas morning, and parents often invoke these lists as a way to
ensure their children are on their best behavior. The lists are
immortalized in the 1934 Christmas song “Santa Claus is coming to Town”:
“He's making a list And checking it twice; Gonna find out Who's naughty
and nice Santa Claus is coming to town
He sees you when you're sleeping He knows when you're awake He knows if
you've been bad or good So be good for goodness sake!”
The Ninth Reindeer, Rudolph
Rudolph, “the most famous reindeer of all,” was born over 100 years
after his eight flying counterparts. The red-nosed wonder was the
creation of Robert L. May, a copywriter at the Montgomery Ward
department store.
In 1939, May wrote a Christmas-themed story-poem to help bring holiday
traffic into his store. Using a similar rhyme pattern to Moore’s “‘Twas
the Night Before Christmas,” May told the story of Rudolph, a young
reindeer who was teased by the other deer because of his large, glowing,
red nose. But, When Christmas Eve turned foggy and Santa worried that he
wouldn’t be able to deliver gifts that night, the former outcast saved
Christmas by leading the sleigh by the light of his red nose. Rudolph’s
message—that given the opportunity, a liability can be turned into an
asset—proved popular.
Montgomery Ward sold almost two and a half million copies of the story
in 1939. When it was reissued in 1946, the book sold over three and half
million copies. Several years later, one of May’s friends, Johnny Marks,
wrote a short song based on Rudolph’s story (1949). It was recorded by
Gene Autry and sold over two million copies. Since then, the story has
been translated into 25 languages and been made into a television movie,
narrated by Burl Ives, which has charmed audiences every year since
1964.
Although “peace on earth” may never have seemed more elusive than during
the Civil War, America’s bloodiest years actually produced our popular
image of Santa Claus. Clement Clarke Moore had injected Santa into the
American psyche with his 1823 poem “A Visit from St. Nicholas” (more
popularly known as “The Night Before Christmas”), but it was four
decades later when the modern-day figure of St. Nick was first outlined
by the pen of noted illustrator Thomas Nast.
The political satirist, who later gained fame parodying both political
parties by drawing an elephant as a symbol for Republicans and a donkey
for Democrats, joined the staff of Harper’s Weekly, one of Civil War
America’s most widely read periodicals, in the summer of 1862. A fervent
supporter of the Union cause, Nast had considerable experience
illustrating Abraham Lincoln, but another bearded figure, Santa Claus,
was his subject for the cover of the magazine’s January 3, 1863 issue.
Nast, who had emigrated from Germany with his family when he was six
years old, tapped his boyhood memories of St. Nicholas to sketch a Santa
with a reindeer-drawn sleigh, long white beard and fur-lined hat and
coat visiting a Union army camp. Nast’s Santa isn’t decked out in red,
however, but a star-spangled outfit featuring red-and-white striped
pants and a blue jacket with white stars. Nast enhances the patriotic
setting by drawing soldiers firing an artillery salute, the Stars and
Stripes flapping proudly in the breeze and a triumphal arch decorated
with evergreens that says, “Welcome Santa Claus.”
Sitting atop his sleigh, Santa hands out gifts that include stockings
and meerschaum pipes and a jack-in-the-box for a pair of young drummer
boys who sit playing in the snow. Santa is clearly not wishing goodwill
to all, however, for in his hands is a dancing puppet of Confederate
president Jefferson Davis with a string tied around his neck that makes
it appear as if he is being lynched by St. Nick. “Santa Claus is
entertaining the soldiers by showing them Jeff Davis’s future,”
expounded Harper’s Weekly. “He is tying a cord pretty tightly round his
neck, and Jeff seems to be kicking very much at such a fate.”
Nast drew less belligerent depictions of Santa Claus inside the same
edition of Harper’s Weekly. One lavish illustration depicts a lonely
Union soldier on Christmas Eve 1862 sitting by a flickering campfire
gazing at photographs of his family while back home his wife kneels with
her hands clasped in prayer wishing for her husband’s safe return as
moonlight illuminates their cherubic children asleep in bed, dreaming of
Santa. The two-page spread includes images of battlefields and
tombstones, but also of Santa climbing down a chimney and being swept
through a Union campground by his reindeer as he tosses presents out of
his sleigh.
Santa became entwined with in the Confederacy as well during the Civil
War. Wartime shortages brought austere Christmases, which required
explanations about Santa’s absence. Some parents explained that the
Union blockade had prevented Santa from traveling to the South, while a
slave even played the ultimate Scrooge by telling a family of children
in Georgia that St. Nick had been shot by the Yankees. The Richmond
Examiner even told Virginia that, no, there wasn’t a Santa Claus. The
newspaper blasted St. Nick as “a Dutch toy-monger” and “an immigrant
from England” who had nothing to do “with genuine Virginia hospitality
and Christmas merry-makings.”
Over the next two decades, Nast’s early woodcuts of Santa Claus
crystallized the modern-day image of a hefty, jolly Kris Kringle with a
long white beard and red outfit. However, the Civil War would not be the
last time that Santa was enlisted for the war effort. During World War
I, Santa was transformed into a patriotic figure along the lines of
Uncle Sam as the U.S. government produced advertisements and artwork
that showed Santa with the troops and hawking war bonds
When World War II came to the United States with the bombing of Pearl
Harbor just weeks before Christmas 1941, Santa Claus was again deployed
to help with the war effort. Santa urged Americans to buy war bonds,
conserve resources and maintain silence to prevent leaks to the enemy.
He was also wrapped in more militaristic iconography. The War Production
Board produced a poster of a jolly, gun-toting Santa with a rifle over
his shoulder that blared, “Santa Claus Has Gone to War!” Gone is St.
Nick’s familiar red suit and hat, replaced by a drab olive army uniform
and helmet. Another War Production Board propaganda poster showed Santa
along with airplanes and munitions with the tidings: “Merry Christmas to
All and to All a Good Fight.” 
A letter to Santa pledged that the weapons would be delivered to
“Messrs. Hitler, Tojo & Mussolini.” It was a not-so-subtle attempt to
use Santa to frame World War II as a conflict between good and evil,
between naughty and nice.
Santa Claus (also known as Saint Nicholas, Saint Nick, Father
Christmas, Kris Kringle, or Santa) is
a legendary figure^([1]) originating in Western Christian culture who is
said to bring gifts during the late evening and overnight hours
on Christmas Eve. He is said to accomplish this with the aid
of Christmas elves, who make the toys in his workshop, and with the aid
of flying reindeer who pull his sleigh through the air.^([2][3])
The popular conception of Santa Claus originates from folklore
traditions surrounding the 4th-century Christian bishop Saint Nicholas,
the patron saint of children. Saint Nicholas became renowned for his
reported generosity and secret gift-giving. This conception also shares
similarities with the English figure of Father Christmas, and they are
both now popularly regarded as the same person.^([4])
Santa is generally depicted as a portly, jolly, white-bearded man, often
with spectacles, wearing a red coat with white fur collar and cuffs,
white-fur-cuffed red trousers, a red hat trimmed with white fur, a black
leather belt and boots, carrying a bag full of gifts for children. He is
popularly associated with a deep, hearty laugh, frequently rendered
in Christmas literature as "ho, ho, ho!"
This image originated in North America during the 19th century,
influenced by Dutch immigrants who brought the legend
of Sinterklaas ("Saint Nicholas") to New Amsterdam (present-day New York
City), and has been maintained and reinforced through song, radio,
television, children's books, family Christmas traditions, films, and
advertising.
Saint Nicholas
Main article: Saint Nicholas
A 13th-century depiction of St. Nicholas from Saint Catherine's
Monastery, Sinai
Saint Nicholas was a 4th-century Greek Christian bishop
of Myra (now Demre) in the region of Lycia in the Roman Empire, today in
Turkey. Nicholas was known for his generous gifts to the poor, in
particular presenting the three impoverished daughters of a pious
Christian with dowries so that they would not have to become
prostitutes.^([5]) He was very religious from an early age and devoted
his life entirely to Christianity. In continental Europe (more precisely
the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, the Czech Republic and Germany), he
is usually portrayed as a bearded bishop in canonical robes.
In 1087, while the Greek Christian inhabitants of Myra were subjugated
by the newly arrived Muslim Seljuq dynasty, and soon after their Greek
Orthodox church had been declared to be in schism by the Catholic church
(1054 AD), a group of merchants from the Italian city of Bari removed
the major bones of Nicholas's skeleton from his sarcophagus in the Greek
church in Myra. Over the objection of the monks of Myra the sailors took
the bones of St. Nicholas to Bari, where they are now enshrined in
the Basilica di San Nicola. Sailors from Bari collected just half of
Nicholas' skeleton, leaving all the minor fragments in the church
sarcophagus. These were later taken by Venetian sailors during the First
Crusade and placed in Venice, where a church to St. Nicholas, the patron
of sailors, was built on the San Nicolò al Lido. St. Nicholas'
vandalized sarcophagus can still be seen in the St. Nicholas Church in
Myra. This tradition was confirmed in two important scientific
investigations of the relics in Bari and Venice, which revealed that the
relics in the two Italian cities belong to the same skeleton. Saint
Nicholas was later claimed as a patron saint of many diverse groups,
from archers, sailors, and children to pawnbrokers.^([5][6]) He is also
the patron saint of both Amsterdam and Moscow.^([7])
During the Middle Ages, often on the evening before his name day of 6
December, children were bestowed gifts in his honour. This date was
earlier than the original day of gifts for the children, which moved in
the course of the Reformation and its opposition to the veneration of
saints in many countries on 24 and 25 December. The custom of gifting to
children at Christmas was propagated by Martin Luther as an alternative
to the previous very popular gift custom on St. Nicholas, to focus the
interest of the children to Christ instead of the veneration of saints.
Martin Luther first suggested the Christkind as the bringer of gifts.
But Nicholas remained popular as gifts bearer for the people.^([8][9])
Father Christmas
"Ghost of Christmas Present", an illustration by John Leech made
for Charles Dickens's festive A Christmas Carol (1843)
Main article: Father Christmas
Father Christmas dates back as far as 16th century in England during the
reign of Henry VIII, when he was pictured as a large man in green or
scarlet robes lined with fur.^([10]) He typified the spirit of good
cheer at Christmas, bringing peace, joy, good food and wine and
revelry.^([10]) As England no longer kept the feast day of Saint
Nicholas on 6 December, the Father Christmas celebration was moved to 25
December to coincide with Christmas Day.^([10]) The Victorian revival of
Christmas included Father Christmas as the emblem of good
cheer.^([11]) His physical appearance was variable,^([12]) with one
image being John Leech's illustration of the "Ghost of Christmas
Present" in Charles Dickens's festive story A Christmas Carol (1843), as
a great genial man in a green coat lined with fur who takes Scrooge
through the bustling streets of London on the current Christmas morning,
sprinkling the essence of Christmas onto the happy populace.^([10][11])
Dutch, Belgian and Swiss folklore

1850 illustration of Saint Nicolas with his servant Père
Fouettard/Zwarte Piet
In the Netherlands and Belgium, the character of Santa Claus competes
with that of Sinterklaas, based on Saint Nicolas. Santa Claus is known
as de Kerstman in Dutch ("the Christmas man") and Père Noël ("Father
Christmas") in French. For children in the Netherlands, Sinterklaas
remains the predominant gift-giver in December; 36% of the Dutch only
give presents on Sinterklaas evening or the day itself, 6
December,^([13]) while Christmas, 25 December, is used by another 21% to
give presents. Some 26% of the Dutch population gives presents on both
days.^([14]) In Belgium, presents are offered exclusively to children on
6 December, and on Christmas Day all ages may receive presents. Saint
Nicolas/Sinterklaas' assistants are called "Pieten" (in Dutch) or "Père
Fouettard" (in French), so they are not elves.^([15])
In Switzerland, Père Fouettard accompanies Père Noël in the French
speaking region, while the sinister Schmutzli accompanies Samichlaus in
the Swiss German region. Schmutzli carries a twig broom to spank the
naughty children.^([16])
Germanic paganism, Wodan, and Christianization
An 1886 depiction of the long-bearded Norse god Odin by Georg von Rosen
Prior to Christianization, the Germanic peoples (including the English)
celebrated a midwinter event called Yule (Old
English geola or giuli).^([17]) With the Christianization of Germanic
Europe, numerous traditions were absorbed from Yuletide celebrations
into modern Christmas,^([18]) such as the Wild Hunt, frequently attested
as being led by the god Odin (Wodan), bearing (among many names) the
names Jólnir, meaning "Yule figure", and Langbarðr, meaning
"long-beard", in Old Norse.^([19])
Wodan's role during the Yuletide period has been theorized as having
influenced concepts of St. Nicholas and Santa Claus in a variety of
facets, including his long white beard and his gray horse for nightly
rides (compare Odin's horse Sleipnir) or his reindeer in North American
tradition.^([20]) Folklorist Margaret Baker maintains that "the
appearance of Santa Claus or Father Christmas, whose day is the 25th of
December, owes much to Odin, the old blue-hooded, cloaked, white-bearded
Giftbringer of the north, who rode the midwinter sky on his eight-footed
steed Sleipnir, visiting his people with gifts. Odin, transformed into
Father Christmas, then Santa Claus, prospered with St Nicholas and
the Christchild, became a leading player on the Christmas stage."^([21])
In northern Europe, the Yule goat was an earlier bearer of gifts, which
has to some degree become conflated with Santa Claus, for instance in
the Finnish Joulupukki tradition.^([22])
HistoryOrigins
Early representations of the gift-giver from Church history and
folklore, especially St Nicholas, merged with the English character
Father Christmas to create the mythical character known to the rest of
the English-speaking world as "Santa Claus" (a phonetic derivation of
"Sinterklaas" in Dutch).
In the English and later British colonies of North America, and later in
the United States, British and Dutch versions of the gift-giver merged
further. For example, in Washington Irving's History of New
York (1809), Sinterklaas was Anglicized into "Santa Claus" (a name first
used in the U.S. press in 1773)^([23]) but lost his bishop's apparel,
and was at first pictured as a thick-bellied Dutch sailor with a pipe in
a green winter coat. Irving's book was a parody of the Dutch culture of
New York, and much of this portrait is his joking
invention.^([24]) Irving's interpretation of Santa Claus was part of a
broader movement to tone down the increasingly wild Christmas
celebrations of the era, which included aggressive home invasions under
the guise of wassailing, substantial premarital sex (leading to shotgun
weddings in areas where the Puritans, waning in power and firmly opposed
to Christmas, still held some influence) and public displays of sexual
deviancy; the celebrations of the era were derided by both upper-class
merchants and Christian purists.^([24])
19th century
Illustration to verse 1 of "Old Santeclaus with Much Delight"
Francis Pharcellus Church, author of the famous 1897 The Sun editorial
which, responding to a letter from eight-year old Virginia O'Hanlon,
contains the line "Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus"
In 1821, the book A New-year's present, to the little ones from five to
twelve was published in New York. It contained "Old Santeclaus with Much
Delight", an anonymous poem describing Santeclaus on a reindeer sleigh,
bringing rewards to children.^([25]) Some modern ideas of Santa Claus
seemingly became canon after the anonymous publication of the poem A
Visit From St. Nicholas (better known today as The Night Before
Christmas) in the Troy, New York, Sentinel on 23 December 1823; Clement
Clarke Moore later claimed authorship, though some scholars argue
that Henry Livingston, Jr. (who died nine years before Moore's claim)
was the author.^([5][26]) St. Nick is described as being "chubby and
plump, a right jolly old elf" with "a little round belly", that "shook
when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly", in spite of which the
"miniature sleigh" and "tiny reindeer" still indicate that he is
physically diminutive. The reindeer were also named: Dasher, Dancer,
Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Dunder and Blixem (Dunder and Blixem came
from the old Dutch words for thunder and lightning, which were later
changed to the more German sounding Donner and Blitzen).^([27])
By 1845, "Kris Kringle" was a common variant of Santa in parts of the
United States.^([28]) A magazine article from 1853, describing American
Christmas customs to British readers, refers to children hanging up
their stockings on Christmas Eve for "a fabulous personage" whose name
varies: in Pennsylvania he is usually called "Krishkinkle", but in New
York he is "St. Nicholas" or "Santa Claus". The author^([29]) quotes
Moore's poem in its entirety, saying that its descriptions apply to
Krishkinkle too.^([30])
As the years passed, Santa Claus evolved into a large, heavyset person.
One of the first artists to define Santa Claus's modern image was Thomas
Nast, a German-born American cartoonist of the 19th century who
immortalized Santa Claus with an illustration for the 3 January 1863
issue of Harper's Weekly in which Santa was dressed in an American flag,
and had a puppet with the name "Jeff" written on it, reflecting its
Civil War context. Nast was inspired by the Belsnickel, part of the
folklure in southwestern Germany, where he was born.^([31]) In this
drawing, Santa is also in a sleigh pulled by
reindeers.^([)^(citation needed)^(])
The story that Santa Claus lives at the North Pole may also have been a
Nast creation. His Christmas image in the Harper's issue dated 29
December 1866 was a collage of engravings titled Santa Claus and His
Works, which included the caption "Santa Claussville, N.P."^([32]) A
colour collection of Nast's pictures, published in 1869, had a poem also
titled "Santa Claus and His Works" by George P. Webster, who wrote that
Santa Claus's home was "near the North Pole, in the ice and
snow".^([33]) The tale had become well known by the 1870s. A boy
from Colorado writing to the children's magazine The Nursery in late
1874 said, "If we did not live so very far from the North Pole, I should
ask Santa Claus to bring me a donkey." ^([34])
The idea of a wife for Santa Claus may have been the creation of
American authors, beginning in the mid-19th century. In 1889, the
poet Katharine Lee Bates popularized Mrs. Claus in the poem "Goody Santa
Claus on a Sleigh Ride". "Is There a Santa Claus?" is the title of an
iconic editorial by Francis Pharcellus Church in the 21 September 1897
edition of The New York Sun that became the most reprinted in the U.S.
and included the famous reply, "Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa
Claus".^([35][36])
In Russia, Ded Moroz emerged as a Santa Claus figure around the late
19th century^([37]) where Christmas for the Eastern Orthodox Church is
kept on 7 January.
20th century
A man dressed as Santa Claus fundraising for Volunteers of America on
the sidewalk of street in Chicago, Illinois, in 1902. He is wearing a
mask with a beard attached.
L. Frank Baum's The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus, a children's
book, was published in 1902. Much of Santa Claus's mythos was not firmly
established at the time, leaving Baum to give his "Neclaus" (Necile's
Little One) a variety of immortal support, a home in the Laughing Valley
of Hohaho, and ten reindeer—who could not fly, but leapt in enormous,
flight-like bounds. Claus's immortality was earned, much like his title
("Santa"), decided by a vote of those naturally immortal. This work also
established Claus's motives: a happy childhood among immortals. When Ak,
Master Woodsman of the World, exposes him to the misery and poverty of
children in the outside world, Santa strives to find a way to bring joy
into the lives of all children, and eventually invents toys as a
principal means. Santa later appears in The Road to Oz as an honored
guest at Ozma's birthday party, stated to be famous and beloved enough
for everyone to bow even before he is announced as "The most Mighty and
Loyal Friend of Children, His Supreme Highness – Santa Claus".
Rose O'Neill's illustration for the 1903 issue of Puck
Images of Santa Claus were conveyed through Haddon Sundblom's depiction
of him for The Coca-Cola Company's Christmas advertising in the
1930s.^([5][38]) The image spawned urban legends that Santa Claus was
invented by The Coca-Cola Company or that Santa wears red and white
because they are the colours used to promote the Coca-Cola
brand.^([39]) Coca-Cola's competitor Pepsi-Cola used similar Santa Claus
paintings in its advertisements in the 1940s and 1950s. Historically,
Coca-Cola was not the first soft drink company to utilize the modern
image of Santa Claus in its advertising—White Rock Beverages had used a
Santa figure in monochrome advertisements for mineral water in 1915, and
in 1923–25, the same company used colour images of Santa Claus in
adverts for drink mixers.^([40]) Earlier, Santa Claus had appeared
dressed in red and white and essentially in his current form on several
covers of Puck magazine in the first few years of the 20th
century.^([41])
The image of Santa Claus as a benevolent character became reinforced
with its association with charity and philanthropy, particularly by
organizations such as the Salvation Army. Volunteers dressed as Santa
Claus typically became part of fundraising drives to aid needy families
at Christmas time.
In 1937, Charles W. Howard, who played Santa Claus in department stores
and parades, established the Charles W. Howard Santa School, the oldest
continuously run such school in the world.^([42])
In some images from the early 20th century, Santa was depicted as
personally making his toys by hand in a small workshop like a craftsman.
Eventually, the idea emerged that he had numerous elves responsible for
making the toys, but the toys were still handmade by each individual elf
working in the traditional manner.
The 1956 popular song by George Melachrino, "Mrs. Santa Claus", and the
1963 children's book How Mrs. Santa Claus Saved Christmas, by Phyllis
McGinley, helped standardize and establish the character and role
of Mrs. Claus in the US.^([43])
Seabury Quinn's 1948 novel Roads draws from historical legends to tell
the story of Santa and the origins of Christmas. Other modern additions
to the "story" of Santa include Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, the 9th
and lead reindeer created in 1939 by Robert L. May, a Montgomery
Ward copywriter, and immortalized in a 1949 song by Gene Autry.
In popular culture

See also: Santa Claus in film and SantaCon
Elves had been portrayed as using assembly lines to produce toys early
in the 20th century. That shift was reflected in the modern depiction of
Santa's residence—now often humorously portrayed as a fully mechanized
production and distribution facility, equipped with the latest
manufacturing technology, and overseen by the elves with Santa and Mrs.
Claus as executives or managers.^([44])
In 1912, actor Leedham Bantock became the first actor to be identified
as having played Santa Claus in a film. Santa Claus, which he also
directed, included scenes photographed in a limited, two-tone colour
process and featured the use of detailed models.^([45]) Since then many
feature films have featured Santa Claus as a protagonist,
including Miracle on 34th Street, The Santa Clause, and Elf.
In the cartoon base, Santa has been voiced by several people,
including Mickey Rooney, Jim Cummings, Mel Smith, Ricky Tomlinson, Jim
Belushi, and Alec Baldwin.
Santa has been described as a positive male cultural icon:
Santa is really the only cultural icon we have who's male, does not
carry a gun, and is all about peace, joy, giving, and caring for other
people. That's part of the magic for me, especially in a culture where
we've become so commercialized and hooked into manufactured icons. Santa
is much more organic, integral, connected to the past, and therefore
connected to the future.
— TV producer Jonathan Meath who portrays Santa, 2011^([46])
Norman Corwin's 1938 comic radio play The Plot to Overthrow Christmas,
set entirely in rhyme, details a conspiracy of the
Devil Mephistopheles and damned figures of history to defeat the good
will among men of Christmas, by sending the Roman emperor Nero to the
North Pole to assassinate Santa Claus. Through a battle of wits, Santa
saves himself by winning Nero over to the joys of Christmas, and gives
him a Stradivarius violin. The play was re-produced in 1940 and 1944.

Many television commercials, comic strips and other media depict this as
a sort of humorous business, with Santa's elves acting as a sometimes
mischievously disgruntled workforce, cracking jokes and pulling pranks
on their boss. For instance, a Bloom County story from 15 December 1981
through 24 December 1981 has Santa rejecting the demands of PETCO
(Professional Elves Toy-Making and Craft Organization) for higher wages,
a hot tub in the locker room, and "Aggressive recruitment of a wider
gender spectrum of employee" ("short broads"), with the elves then going
on strike. President Reagan steps in, fires all of Santa's helpers, and
replaces them with out-of-work air traffic controllers (an obvious
reference to the 1981 air traffic controllers' strike), resulting in a
riot before Santa vindictively rehires them in humiliating new positions
such as his reindeer.^([47]) In the 2001 The Sopranos episode, "To Save
Us All from Satan's Power", Paulie Gualtieri says he "Used to think
Santa and Mrs. Claus were running a sweatshop over there. The original
elves were ugly, traveled with Santa to throw bad kids a beatin', and
gave the good ones toys."
2009 Liverpool Santa Dash
In Kyrgyzstan, a mountain peak was named after Santa Claus, after a
Swedish company had suggested the location be a more efficient starting
place for present-delivering journeys all over the world, than Lapland.
In the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek, a Santa Claus Festival was held on 30
December 2007, with government officials attending. 2008 was officially
declared the Year of Santa Claus in the country. The events are seen as
moves to boost tourism in Kyrgyzstan.^([48])
The Guinness World Record for the largest gathering of Santa Clauses is
held by Thrissur, Kerala, India where on 27 December 2014, 18,112 Santas
overtook the previous record. Derry City, Northern Ireland had held the
record since 9 September 2007, when a total of 12,965 people dressed up
as Santa or Santa's helpers. Prior to that, the record was 3,921, which
was set during the Santa Dash event in Liverpool City Centre in
2005.^([49]) A gathering of Santas in 2009 in Bucharest, Romania
attempted to top the world record, but failed with only 3,939

Christmas Eve

In the United States and Canada, children may leave a glass of milk and
a plate of cookies intended for Santa; in Britain, Australia and New
Zealand, sherry or beer, and mince pies are left instead. In Denmark,
Norway and Sweden, it is common for children to leave him rice porridge
with sugar and cinnamon instead. In Ireland it is popular to
leave Guinness or milk, along with Christmas pudding or mince pies.
In Hungary, St. Nicolaus (Mikulás) or Father Winter (Télapó) comes on
the night of 5 December and the children get their gifts the next
morning. They get sweets in a bag if they were good, and a golden
coloured birch switch if not. On Christmas Eve "Little Jesus" comes and
gives gifts for everyone.^([53])
In Slovenia, Saint Nicholas (Miklavž) also brings small gifts for good
children on the eve of 6 December. Božiček (Christmas Man) brings gifts
on the eve of 25 December, and Dedek Mraz (Grandfather Frost) brings
gifts in the evening of 31 December to be opened on New Years Day.
After the children have fallen asleep, parents play the role of Santa
Claus and leave their gifts under the Christmas tree, which may be
signed as being "from Santa Claus".^([54][55][56])
An archetypal North American depiction of Santa Claus
Appearance
A man dressed as Santa Claus waves to children from an annual holiday
train in Chicago, 2012.
Santa is generally depicted as a portly, jolly, white-bearded man, often
with spectacles, wearing a red outfit consisting of jacket, trousers and
hat all trimmed with white fur, accessorized with black leather belt and
boots, and carrying a bag full of gifts for children. The 1823 poem "A
Visit from St. Nicholas" popularized this image in North America during
the 19th century. Caricaturist and political cartoonist Thomas Nast also
played a role in the creation of Santa's image.^([57][58][59])
The traditional 1823 Christmas poem A Visit from St. Nicholas relates
that Santa has:
"a little round belly That shook when he laugh'd, like a bowl full of
jelly"
Though most often portrayed as white, Santa is also depicted as black or
of other races. His race or colour is sometimes a subject of
controversy.^([60][61])
Laugh
"Ho ho ho" redirects here. For other uses, see Ho ho ho
(disambiguation).
Ho ho ho is the way that many languages write out how Santa Claus
laughs. "Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!" It is the textual rendition of a
particular type of deep-throated laugh or chuckle, most associated today
with Santa Claus and Father Christmas.
The laughter of Santa Claus has long been an important attribute by
which the character is identified, but it also does not appear in many
non-English-speaking countries.^([)^(citation needed)^(])

Santa.
Santa's House at Jerusalem Old City, St. Peter Street
Santa Claus's home is traditionally said to include a residence and a
workshop where he is said to create—often with the aid of elves or other
supernatural beings—the gifts he is said to deliver to good children at
Christmas. Some stories and legends include a village, inhabited by his
helpers, surrounding his home and shop.
Santa is traditionally said to live at the North Pole, which according
to Canada Post lies within Canadian jurisdiction in postal code H0H
0H0^([62]) (a reference to "ho ho ho", Santa's notable saying, although
postal codes starting with H are usually reserved for the island of
Montréal in Québec). On 23 December 2008, Jason Kenney,
Canada's minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism,
formally awarded Canadian citizenship status to Santa Claus. "The
Government of Canada wishes Santa the very best in his Christmas Eve
duties and wants to let him know that, as a Canadian citizen, he has the
automatic right to re-enter Canada once his trip around the world is
complete," Kenney said in an official statement.^([63]) There is also a
city named North Pole in Alaska where a tourist attraction known as the
"Santa Claus House" has been established. The United States Postal
Service recommends mail to Santa's workshop be sent to 123 Elf Road,
North Pole, 88888.^([64]) The British postal service, Royal Mail,
recommends letters are sent to Santa/Father Christmas, Santa's Grotto,
Reindeerland, XM4 5HQ.^([65])
Each Nordic country claims Santa's residence to be within their
territory. Norway claims he lives in Drøbak. In Denmark, he is said to
live in Greenland (near Uummannaq). In Sweden, the town of Mora has a
theme park named Tomteland. The national postal terminal in Tomteboda in
Stockholm receives children's letters for Santa. In
Finland, Korvatunturi in Lapland has long been known as Santa's home,
and two theme parks, Santa Claus Village and Santa Park are located
near Rovaniemi. In Belarus, there is a home of Ded
Moroz in Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Park.^([66])
In France, Santa is believed to reside in 1 Chemin des Nuages, Pôle Nord
(1 Alley of Clouds, North Pole). The French national postal service has
operated a service that allows children to send letters to Père Noël
since 1962.^([67]) In the period before Christmas, any physical letter
in the country that is addressed to Santa Claus is sent to a specific
location, where responses for the children's letters are written and
sent back to the children.^([68])

Representation of Santa Claus in Italy
Actors portraying Santa Claus are present at various venues in the weeks
leading up to Christmas. A concept devised by retail entrepreneur David
Lewis, the first Christmas grotto opened in Lewis's department store
in Liverpool, England in 1879.^([69]) The idea then took hold throughout
the UK,^([70]) before extending to Australian and American department
stores in the 1890s, with James Edgar starting in 1890 in his Brockton,
Massachusetts department store.^([71]) Having a Santa actor set up to
take pictures with children is a ritual that dates back at least to
1918.^([72]) An area is often set aside for the actors portraying Santa
to use for the duration of the holiday season. It usually features a
chair for the actors to sit in surrounded by various holiday-themed
decorations. In Canada, malls operated by Oxford Properties established
a process by which autistic children could "visit Santa Claus" at the
mall without having to contend with crowds.^([73]) The malls open early
to allow entry only to families with autistic children, who have a
private visit with the actor portraying Santa Claus. In 2012,
the Southcentre Mall in Calgary was the first mall to offer this
service.^([74]) In the UK, the discount store Poundland changes the
voice of its self-service checkouts to that of Santa Claus throughout
the Christmas retail period.^([75])
There are schools offering instruction on how to act as Santa Claus. For
example, children's television producer Jonathan Meath studied at the
International School of Santa Claus and earned the degree Master of
Santa Claus in 2006. It blossomed into a second career for him, and
after appearing in parades and malls,^([76]) he appeared on the cover of
the American monthly Boston Magazine as Santa.^([77]) There are
associations with members who portray Santa; for example, Mr. Meath was
a board member of the international organization called Fraternal Order
of Real Bearded Santas.^([78])
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many Santa grottos were not operating for
the 2020 Christmas season. Due to this, some companies offered video
calls for a fee using apps such as Zoom where children could speak to an
actor who was dressed as Santa Claus.^([79])
In 2021, Walt Disney World and Disneyland featured for the first time
Black cast members portraying Santa.^([80])
Letter writing
"Letters to Santa" redirects here. For the Muppet television film, see A
Muppets Christmas: Letters to Santa. For the Polish film, see Letters to
Santa (film).
Children sometimes write letters to Santa Claus, often with a wish list
of presents that they wish to receive.^([81][82]) Some postal services
recognize this tradition, and may accept letters addressed to "Santa
Claus".^([83]) Writing letters to Santa Claus has the educational
benefits of promoting literacy, computer literacy, and e-mail literacy.
A letter to Santa is often a child's first experience of correspondence.
Written and sent with the help of a parent or teacher, children learn
about the structure of a letter, salutations, and the use of an address
and postcode.^([84])
According to the Universal Postal Union (UPU)'s 2007 study and survey of
national postal operations, the United States Postal Service (USPS) has
the oldest Santa letter answering effort by a national postal system.
The USPS Santa letter answering effort started in 1912 out of the
historic James Farley Post Office^([85]) in New York, and since 1940 has
been called "Operation Santa" to ensure that letters to Santa are
adopted by charitable organizations, major corporations, local
businesses and individuals in order to fulfill the wishes of
children.^([83]) Those seeking a North Pole holiday postmark through the
USPS, are told to send their letter from Santa or a holiday greeting
card by 10 December to: North Pole Holiday Postmark, Postmaster, 4141
Postmark Dr, Anchorage, AK 99530–9998.^([86])
In 2006, according to the UPU's 2007 study and survey of national postal
operations, France's Postal Service received the most letters for Santa
Claus or "Père Noël" with 1,220,000 letters received from 126
countries.^([87]) France's Postal Service in 2007 specially recruited
someone to answer the enormous volume of mail that was coming from
Russia for Santa Claus.^([83])
Other Santa letter processing information, according to the UPU's 2007
study and survey of national postal operations, include:^([83])

-   Countries whose national postal operators answer letters to Santa
    and other end-of-year holiday figures, and the number of letters
    received in 2006: Germany (500,000), Australia (117,000), Austria
    (6,000), Bulgaria (500), Canada (1,060,000), Spain (232,000), United
    States (no figure, as statistics are not kept centrally), Finland
    (750,000), France (1,220,000), Ireland (100,000), New Zealand
    (110,000), Portugal (255,000), Poland (3,000), Slovakia (85,000),
    Sweden (150,000), Switzerland (17,863), Ukraine (5,019), United
    Kingdom (750,000).

-   In 2006, Finland's national postal operation received letters from
    150 countries (representing 90% of the letters received), France's
    Postal Service from 126 countries, Germany from 80 countries, and
    Slovakia from 20 countries.

-   In 2007, Canada Post replied to letters in 26 languages and Deutsche
    Post in 16 languages.

-   Some national postal operators make it possible to send in e-mail
    messages which are answered by physical mail. All the same, Santa
    still receives far more letters than e-mail through the national
    postal operators, proving that children still write letters.
    National postal operators offering the ability to use an on-line web
    form (with or without a return e-mail address) to Santa and obtain a
    reply include Canada Post^([88]) (on-line web request form in
    English and French), France's Postal Service (on-line web request
    form in French),^([89][90]) and New Zealand Post^([91]) (on-line web
    request form in English).^([92]) In France, by 6 December 2010, a
    team of 60 postal elves had sent out reply cards in response to
    80,000 e-mail on-line request forms and more than 500,000 physical
    letters.^([84])
    From 2002 to 2014, Canada Post replied to approximately "one million
    letters or more a year, and in total answered more than 24.7 million
    letters";^([93]) as of 2015, it responds to more than 1.5 million
    letters per year, "in over 30 languages, including Braille answering
    them all in the language they are written".^([94]) The tradition
    also exists in Great Britain^([95]) and Finland.^([84])
    In Latin America, letters are sometimes tied to balloons instead of
    being sent through the mail.^([96])
    An example of a public and private cooperative venture is the
    opportunity for expatriate and local children and parents to receive
    postmarked mail and greeting cards from Santa during December in the
    Finnish Embassy in Beijing, People's Republic of China,^([97]) Santa
    Claus Village in Rovaniemi, Finland, and the People's Republic of
    China Postal System's Beijing International Post
    Office.^([98][99][100])

    Claus" streaking across a weather radar screen, 1958
    A number of websites have been created by various organizations that
    have claimed to track Santa Claus' yearly journey. Some, such
    as NORAD Tracks Santa, the Google Santa Tracker, the emailSanta.com
    Tracker^([101]) and the Santa Update Project, have endured. Others,
    such as the Airservices Australia Tracks Santa
    Project,^([102][103][104]) the Dallas/Fort Worth International
    Airport's Tracks Santa Project,^([105][106][107]) the NASA Tracks
    Santa Project,^([108]) and the Bing Maps Platform Tracks Santa
    Project,^([109][110]) have not.
    1955 Sears ad with the misprinted telephone number that led to the
    creation of the NORAD Tracks Santa program
    NORAD Tracks Santa originated in 1955 when a Sears-Roebuck ad
    incorrectly printed the number for their Santa hotline and
    the Continental Air Defense Command received the calls intended for
    the Sears hotline. The program was transferred to NORAD when it was
    jointly founded by the United States and Canada in
    1958.^([111][112])
    In December 2000, the Weather Channel built upon these local efforts
    to provide a national Christmas Eve "Santa tracking" effort, called
    "SantaWatch", in cooperation with NASA, the International Space
    Station, and Silicon Valley–based new multimedia firm Dreamtime
    Holdings.^([113]) Currently, most local television stations in the
    United States and Canada rely upon outside established "Santa
    tracking" efforts, such as NORAD Tracks Santa.^([114])
    In addition to providing holiday-themed entertainment, "Santa
    tracking" websites raise interest in space
    technology and exploration,^([115]) serve to educate children in
    geography^([116]) and encourage them to take an interest in
    science.
    Many websites exist that claim to track Santa and his workshop. One
    particular website called emailSanta.com was created when a
    1997 Canada Post strike prevented Alan Kerr's young niece and
    nephews from sending their letters to Santa; in a few weeks, over
    1,000 emails to Santa were received, and the site had received 1,000
    emails a day one year later.^([118][119]) Some websites, such as
    Santa's page on Microsoft's former Windows Live Spaces or
    emailSanta.com, have used or still use "bots" or other automated
    programs to compose and send personalized and realistic
    replies.
